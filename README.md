This is a tool for converting ATF, a text markup format used by
the Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative to describe inscriptions
on clay tablets and other artefacts, and TEI, and XML markup format
used by the Text Encoding Initiative for digital representation
of scholarly texts.

It is intended as part of an interface to make the CDLI and related
databases more accessible.

The project was originally written as part of a Google Summer of Code
project in 2019.
