# atf2tei

This is a tool for converting [ATF](http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/doc/help/editinginatf/),
a text markup format used by the [Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative](https://cdli.ucla.edu)
to describe inscriptions on clay tablets and other artefacts,
and [TEI](https://tei-c.org), an [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML)
markup format used by the Text Encoding Initiative for digital representation
of scholarly texts.

It is intended as part of an interface to make the CDLI and related
databases more accessible.

The project was originally written as part of a Google
[Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)
project in 2019.
